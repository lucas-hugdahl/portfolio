  <p class="about__bio">Hey there, I am a creative from Seattle, WA. I love to work on old cars and motorcycles, take photos, write music, sail, and of course, build sweet websites. I have been designing and developing websites from front to back for 5 years now. Throughout my  development career I have had the privillege to build website for large brands such as Microsot and SONY. I am constantly learning new skills and reworking old code. </p>
